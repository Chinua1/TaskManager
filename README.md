# taskmanager
A task management system that can deal with tasks of multiple users. Users will have the ability to create task boards which are collections of tasks. Users will also have the ability to invite other users to see and interact with their created boards. For example if I create a board I can add users to it and anyone who creates a task can assign that task to any user who is part of that board. Users should be able to edit and delete tasks as well as mark them complete. The only person who can delete the entire board though is the original creator. For this application i exploited the parent child relationships available through the NoSQL database. I was also required to build this application without using a query of any kind.
